## ARChTools
[LIVE DEMO](https://archtools.vercel.app/)

ARChTools is an ongoing web application that intends to offer multiple tools and widgets to architects, graphic designers, and urban planners in order to improve the way in which some design processes take place at a professional level. ARChTools' main goal is to provide an easy way to implement design theory during project production with the use of calculators and gadgets, including:

- Color theory, contrast, typography
- Composition, geometry, hierarchy, order
- Golden ratio, anthropometry, proportion, UC design
- Custom design-oriented calculators


This project is currently under construction, meaning there will be upcoming changes for better accessibility, styling, user experience, and other minor fixes.
